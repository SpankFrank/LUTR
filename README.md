When comparing transcripts of the Bible in its original language and the Bible in Latin,
Martin Luther realized that some of its meaning had been lost in translation. Similarly,
UnTranslated Regions (UTRs) are lost in translation. However, to us biologist and
bioinformaticians they are of great importance as they have a variety of regulatory
functions and a genome annotation without them wouldn't really be complete, right?

Protein ortholog-based gene prediction enables the transfer of detailed gene structure and
functional annotations across species by leveraging evolutionary conservation. However,
genome annotations from such methods typically lack the less conserved UTRs. LUTR
supplements these by using matching transcripts from reference-based transcriptome assemblies.

                    UTR-extensions for transcripts in functional annotations from orthology-based gene prediction tools
                    using matching transcripts in structural annotations from reference-based transcriptome assembly.

                    Additional parameter explanation:
                    *1 By default, LUTR only allows transcript matches in which all other exons between the first and
                       last matched exon must also be matched exactly. This is based on the assumption that UTRs can
                       affect splicing within the coding regions of a transcript, e.g. by changing its secondary
                       structure.
                    *2 By default, LUTR assignes assembled transcripts only to the matching predicted transcripts they
                       share the most bases with. Assigning them to all matching predicted transcripts can increase the
                       number of annotated UTRs but bears the risk of an increased rate of false positives.
                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -mf, --mftm                   Minimum fraction of the predicted transcript to be matched [default: 0.9]
  -mb, --mtbm                   Minimum bases of the predicted transcript to be matched [default: 10,000]

### 2.1 Input

Input annotations are required to be in GFF3 format.
agat_sp_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl from [AGAT](https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT) can be used to convert from GTF to GFF.

To generate an assembly annotation matching your predicted one you can use the assembly
pipeline described in section 3.

### 2.2 Output

Contents of the output directory:

| Item       | Explanation                    |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| lutr.gff   | Final annotation               |
| lutr.param | File with run parameters       |
| lutr.log   | File with log messages         |
| tmpdir     | "Temporary" directory          |
| step_1     | indicates completion of step 1 |

The "temporary" directory stores the annotations for each gene, however it is not deleted automatically.
This allows skipping step 1 when re-running LUTR with different parameters.

Running agat_sp_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl from [AGAT](https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT)
on lutr.gff is recommended for the removal of duplicated isoforms

# 3 Additional scripts

LUTR comes with two additional scripts:
```
assembly -h
noUTR -h
```

**assembly**<br>
Assembly pipeline
- Short read mapping with STAR (or input of mapped reads)
- Long read mapping with Minimap2 (or input of mapped reads)
- Assembly with StringTie

**noUTR**<br>
Generating UTR-clipped annotations of coding genes<br>
Caution: Duplicates from isoforms using identical CDS but different UTR are not removed. This can be done with agat_convert_gxf2gxf.pl!

## 4 LUTR workflow

### Step 1: Gene pair slice extraction

LUTR creates GFF-slices for all predicted genes and their overlapping assembled genes.

1. GFF-File loading as pandas.DataFrame
2. GFF-File chromosome slice generation
3. Identification of pairs of overlapping predicted and assembled genes
4. GFF-File gene slice generation for gene pairs*

### Step 2: Gene pair slice processing
Transcript matching, removal of unsupported transcripts and UTR-variant generation

1. Matching pairs of predicted and assembled transcripts exon by exon according to user defined parameters
2. Removal of unmatched predicted transcripts (only if parameter --remove was set.
3. Generation of UTR-variants if matching assembled transcripts extend predicted ones
4. Length based selection of UTR-variants (according to --select parameter)

# 5 Testing LUTR

## 5.1 Test data

### 5.1.1 Prediction

An idealized "prediction" of coding sequences was created from the mouse GRCm39 reference annotation.
1. [noUTR.py](https://github.com/SimonHegele/LUTR/blob/main/src/scripts/noUTR.py) was used to remove UTRs from the annotation.
2. agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl from [AGAT](https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT) was used to remove duplicated transcript isoforms.

### 5.1.2. Assemblies

Assembly 1:
perfect “assembly” / goal annotation (full reference gene records)

Assembly 2:
~600 million Illumina read pairs (SRA-ID: PRJNA375882), mapped with [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
~ 60 million r2c2 nanopore reads (SRA-ID: PRJNA971991), mapped with [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
assembled with [StringTie3](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie) in conservative mode 

## 5.2 Computational ressources

Test 1:<br>
required RAM:   ~4.8GB<br>
required Time:  05m26s (64 threads, server) / 30m20s (8 threads, laptop)

Test 2:<br>
required RAM:   ~3.9GB<br>
required Time:  04m35s (64 threads, server) / 21m54 (8 threads, laptop)

The required time required to process a gene is highly dependent on the number of isoforms annotated.<br>
While most genes are processed within a fraction of a second, genes with many isoforms may take more than a minute to process.

### 5.3.3 Interpretation

The reconstruction of the reference annotation from the idealized data is very close to the original.<br>
At the same time LUTR inherits the problems of the methods used to create the input annotations.

# 6. Comparison to predecessor UTRpy

**LUTR uses hasmaps for parent-child relationships**<br>
After loading GFF-files a map that reflects parent to child relationships is constructed.<br>
This allows fast extraction of records.

**LUTR improves parallelization:**<br>
UTRpy: Splitting of annotations into chromosome slices<br>
-> Number of usable CPU-cores limited by the number of chromosomes<br>
-> Workload is not distributed evenly among processes<br>
LUTR: Splitting of annotations into chromosome slices first and into gene slices second<br>
-> Number of usable CPU-cores practically unlimited<br>
-> Even distribution of workload among processes

**LUTR improves transcript matching:**<br>
UTRpy:<br>
-> Attempts matching for each pair of assembled and predicted transcript on a chromosome. <br>
-> Only allows only perfect transcript matches<br>
LUTR:<br>
-> Attempts matching only for pairs of assembled and predicted transcript when the assembled and predicted genes overlap<br>
-> Acknowledes potential incompleteness of assembled transcriptomes or transcripts and provides parameters allowing imperfect matches<br>

LUTR is significantly more efficient, especially for annotations from gene predictions, where genes may have multiple annotated isoforms.
